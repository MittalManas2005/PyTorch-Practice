Topics (what is present in which notebook in order of the notebook numbers)
1. Contains basic definitions and concepts for Deep Learning and Neural Networks in general. 
2. Tensors : contains the tensor module in the PyTorch framework.
3. Autograd : Important module of PyTorch which helps in automatic differentation.
4. Training_Pipeline : contains a very general training pipeline for deep learning . It includes custom code and their better implementation using torch.nn and torch.optim modules
5. Dataset and Dataloader : contains code for better handling the input data and leverage batch processing
6. ANN : Contains code for a a muliple layer neural network for multiple class classification. It includes all the concepts of the above notebooks. It uses the a subset of the Fashion MNIST dataset.
